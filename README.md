## Purpose

Manages the shots of a Blender scene. It offers a real-time editing directly on
the data of a 3D scene.
Shot Manager is very versatile and can be useful in many cases.
The main use case is this: A continuous action is set in a scene, then some cameras
are put at the appropriate places in the world and a shot is created for each one of
them in order to record the right segment of time.
This is very convenient for previz and 3D layout.

With version 2.0 it is now possible to start even earlier in production by drawing your own storyboard directly inside Blender 
and to smoothly convert the shots from 2D to 3D.
