>
>It was initially developed for an animated TV series production in 2020 on Blender 2.83. It has the features that were needed at the time but it
may not be considered as feature complete for a more generic purpose. In spite of all our efforts to make it reliable some troubles may occur in use cases we have not faced.

<br />

Note that development is on Windows 10. Please report issues and submit PRs for other OSs.

## Purpose

Manages the shots of a Blender scene. It offers a real-time editing directly on
the data of a 3D scene.
Shot Manager is very versatile and can be useful in many cases.
The main use case is this: A continuous action is set in a scene, then some cameras
are put at the appropriate places in the world and a shot is created for each one of
them in order to record the right segment of time.
This is very convenient for previz and 3D layout.
