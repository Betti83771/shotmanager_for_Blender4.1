History
-------
Shot Manager is a pre-production tool that was initialy developed to support the previz of an animated TV series we did at Ubisoft between
January 2020 and February 2021. From the very beginning we knew we wanted to share it with the Blender community so we released it
as part of an open source project on GitHub during summer 2021. Since that time it is used internaly at Ubisoft as well as
by several animation production companies and individuals, and we keep supporting it.

Read this article to see how we used this tool on the TV production of Rabbids Invasion: Mission to Mars: `User Stories - Blender and the Rabbids <https://www.blender.org/user-stories/blender-and-the-rabbids/?utm_source=www-homepage>`__.
