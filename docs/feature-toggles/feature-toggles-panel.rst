Feature Toggles panel
=====================


Feature toggles are a set of toggles that can be triggered to display additional features extending the capabilities of Shot Manager.
When activated a module and its related graphics components will become visible in the main panel, at various places
according to its way of working.

**Modules are not enabled by default because they can add a significant complexity to the genereal interface of Shot Manager.
It is then strongly advised to activate only the ones you need, at the time you need. You can reactivate them at will.**

**Modules are just UI components. Disabling a module will not change anything in the scene or in the current configuration of Shot Manager.**
