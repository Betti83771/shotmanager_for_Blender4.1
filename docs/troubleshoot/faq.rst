Why is Shot Manager still not working on Blender 2.93 on Mac and Linux?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several functionalities of Shot Manager rely on OpenTimelineIO, a Python framework developped
by Pixar and dedicated to the transfert of editings from one video application to another.

Currently this library is available for Python 3.9 but we build the package for Windows only.

This should be fixed soon.
