How to master the basics
========================

A lot of things still to be added here...

How to create new shots
-----------------------

Press on the *+* button on the right side of the shots lists.


How to create take variations
-----------------------------

Open the Take Tools menu from the Take Tools button located at the right side of the take title line and choose
*Add...*. This will create a new take and wou will be able to switch from one to another thanks to the take
dropdown component.

Takes are completely autonomous one from each other.
**Nevertheless the shots they contain may refer to the same cameras, so modifying a camera in the scene may affect
several takes!**


How to render the shots
-----------------------

In the right toolbox of the viewport you will find a tab named *Shot Mnger - Render*. This opens the Shot Manager
rendering panel.

From there you will be able to render a single image, a shot, the whole take, and to control the rendering settings.
