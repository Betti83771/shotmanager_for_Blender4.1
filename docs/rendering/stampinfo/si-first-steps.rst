First steps
===========

If you haven't done it yet, it is time to read the :ref:`Stamp Info General Philosophy <si-general-philosophy>` 
to clearly understand the purpose of this tool.


.. raw:: html

   <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 45%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 80%; border:solid 0.1em; border-color:#4d4d4d; align=center; margin: auto;">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sj2GyYhxFX4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   </div>

Once the add-on is installed open the Stamp Info panel. You will have to explicitely display it from the :ref:`Features Toggle Panel <feature-toggles-panel>`

The first thing to do, for each new scene, is to define how the stamped information will be written
onto the rendered image. To do so choose between the 2 avalable modes of the :ref:`Final Resolution Mode <final-resolution>`
dropdown list.

Check the information you want to see displayed in the rendered images in the various category rollouts.

Then when calling a rendering from the Shot Manager Render Panel the final image(s) will be computed according
to the render settings of the scene.
