First steps and tutorials
=========================

If you haven't done it yet, it is time to read the :ref:`Shot Manager General Philosophy <general-philosophy>` 
to clearly understand the purpose of this tool.


Shot Manager doesn't have official video tutorials at the moment. Nevertheless it is still possible to get all the concepts and basics
thanks to the involvement of soem users who greatly appreciate this tool.

**Paul Coulthard** (`Spitfire Storyboards <https://www.youtube.com/c/SpitfireStoryboards/>`__) is one of them. Skilled storyboarder, very enthusiastic about the potential of Blender, he did a very complete introduction
to Shot Manager and his own way of working in a livestream in October.
