Install of Shot Manager
-----------------------

.. note::
    Shot Manager needs to download some external Python dependencies in order to be fully functional. Hence,
    when launching the installation of this add-on, be sure to match these conditions:

        - **Run Blender with elevated privileges (or in Administrator mode)**
        - **Be connected to the internet**
        - **Be sure the firewall is not blocking the requests (use OpenVPN or equivalent if needed)**


Launch Blender, open the **Preferences** panel and go to the **Add-ons** section.
Press the **Install** button located at the top of the panel. A dialog box opens, pick the Shot Manager
zip file you previously downloaded and validate.
The add-on will be installed. Click on the checkbox at the left side of its name to enable it.

Once the addon is enabled, a Shot Manager tab is displayed in the 3D viewport N-Panel.

**Close Blender and restart it in normal mode.**


Install of complementary add-ons
--------------------------------

**Since Shot Manager 2.0 there is no need to install the aditional add-ons that where required with the previous versions.**

Indeed Ubisoft Stamp Info has been integrated directly into Shot Manager, and Video Tracks will follow the same path in a near future.
