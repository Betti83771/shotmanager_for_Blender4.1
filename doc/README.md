Shot Manager is a production tool. At the moment it is not yet completely opened to external contributions. Any feedback is very welcome though.


## Documentation

The technical documentation is currently being written.

In particular some focus is being done to a UI components structure based on BGL and GPU and used to create advanced
UI components in the various editors of Blender.
As an example, the Interactive Shots Stack and the Sequence Timeline and based on it.
Read more about it here: [gpu 2D library](../shotmanager/gpu/gpu_2d/doc_gpu_2d_components.md)
