What happens during...
----------------------

Note: Separators in file names can be different in practice according to the settings or Project settings


A Take rendering:
=================

    - if Stamp Info is activated:

        - for each enabled shot of the current take:
            - the shot is rendered as PNG file in its own temp directory named:
                <take name>\<shot name>_intermediate\<shot name>_<frame>.png
            - the Stamp Info frame files are rendered in the same temp directory:
                <take name>\<shot name>_intermediate\_tmp_StampInfo_<shot name>_<frame>.png
            - currently a wav file is also rendered

            - in the VSE of a temp scene named Tmp_VSE_RenderScene<shot name> those 3 renderings are composited and rendered as a .mp4 file in:
                <take name>\<sequence name>_<shot name>.mp4
              
              This temp scene is then deleted


        - for the sequence:
            - in the VSE of a temp scene named VSE_SequenceRenderScene:
                - the video part of the .mp4 of each shot is added to the edit
                - the sound part of the .mp4 of each shot is added to the track above
                - a video is rendered in:
                    <take name>\<sequence name>_<take name>.mp4

    - if Stamp Info is NOT activated:



A Playblast rendering:
======================

    **Playblast mode is NOT related to the use of Project Settings**

    - if Stamp Info is activated:
        - each enabled shot of the current take is rendered as PNG file in its own temp directory
        - for each enabled shot the SI files are rendered in the directory of each shot

        - each shot is rendered as a video?
        Or the full seq is based on all the shots?

    - if Stamp Info is NOT activated:
        -
