    """
    The View coordinate system of the region is a screen coordinate system, in pixels.
    Its origin is at the bottom left corner of the region (not of the area!), y axis pointing toward the top.

    The Region coordinate system of the region is a coordinate system depending on the state of the rulers or scroll bars.
    For dopesheets and timelines the X axis units are the frames and the Y axis units are values. For better commodity we
    are rather using lines, a line is 20 values height when the global UI scale factor is 1.0.
    Its origin is at the bottom left corner of the region (not of the area!), y axis pointing toward the top.

    The origin of the object (its position) is at its bottom left, y pointing topward.

    Class properties:

        posXIsInRegionCS:   If True the position on X axis is in the View coordinate system of the region, posX is then in pixels
                            The position X of the object will NOT change even if the region scale on x is changed (eg: time zoom)

                            If False the position on X axis is in the Region coordinate system, in frames.
                            The position X of the object will change if the region scale on x is changed (eg: time zoom)

                            Use posXIsInRegionCS = True to display a quad with a constant position on x on the screen
                            Use posXIsInRegionCS = False to display a clip that has to stay as a specific frame (a key for eg)

        posX:               The position on the X axis of the object. Its unit is in pixels if posXIsInRegionCS is True, in frames otherwise


        posYIsInRegionCS:   If True the position on Y axis is in the View coordinate system of the region, posY is then in pixels
                            The position Y of the object will NOT change even if the region scale on y is changed (eg: not dependent on lines scale)

                            If False the position on X axis is in the Region coordinate system, in number of lines.
                            The position Y of the object will change if the region scale on y is changed (eg: surface that has to mach a line height)

                            Note that the actual height of a line in pixels depends on the global UI scale factor.
                            Use posYIsInRegionCS = True to display a static quad for example
                            Use posYIsInRegionCS = False to display a clip that has to match a line position

        posY:               The position on the Y axis of the object. Its unit is in pixels if posYIsInRegionCS is True, in lines otherwise


        widthIsInRegionCS:  If True the width is in the View coordinate system of the region, width is then in pixels
                            Width of the object will NOT change even if the region scale on x is changed (eg: time zoom)

                            If False the width is in the Region coordinate system, in frames.
                            Width of the object will change if the region scale on x is changed (eg: time zoom)

                            Use widthIsInRegionCS = True to display a quad with a constant width on screen
                            Use widthIsInRegionCS = False to display a clip that has to match a given amount of frames width

        width:              The width of the object. Its unit is in pixels if widthIsInRegionCS is True, in frames otherwise


        heightIsInRegionCS:   If True the height is in the View coordinate system of the region, height is then in pixels
                            Height of the object will NOT change even if the region scale on y is changed (eg: not dependent on lines scale)

                            If False the height is in the Region coordinate system, in number of lines.
                            Height of the object will change if the region scale on y is changed (eg: surface that has to mach a line height)

                            Note that the actual height of a line in pixels depends on the global UI scale factor.
                            Use heightIsInRegionCS = True to display a static quad for example
                            Use heightIsInRegionCS = False to display a clip that has to match a line height

        height:             The height of the object. Its unit is in pixels if heightIsInRegionCS is True, in lines otherwise

        alignment:          aligment of the object to its origin
                            can be TOP_LEFT, TOP_MID, TOP_RIGHT, MID_RIGHT, BOTTOM_RIGHT, BOTTOM_MID, BOTTOM_LEFT (default), MID_LEFT, MID_MID

        alignmentToRegion: aligment of the object to its parent region
                            can be TOP_LEFT, TOP_MID, TOP_RIGHT, MID_RIGHT, BOTTOM_RIGHT, BOTTOM_MID, BOTTOM_LEFT (default), MID_LEFT, MID_MID
